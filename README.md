# hydro

This is a small map-based site for browsing real-time hydrometry from Environment Canada.

Browse stations using the map or search for a station using the search box. Water levels are shown hourly for the last few days.

A live version can be found here: http://robskelly.com/maps/hydro/

A brief explanation of the project can be found here: http://robskelly.com/#hydro

* Note: this application depends on a small REST framework that is not currently public.
